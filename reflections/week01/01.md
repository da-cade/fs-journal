## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git to store code, create different versions of it, and track changes made by different people working on it.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple branches can be used to work with different versions of our project without manipulating the original, or to test changes before they are committed to.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is a tool that creates local repositories and tracks the changes made to them; Github is a host for remote repositories that can be seen by others.
