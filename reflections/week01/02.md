## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A Pseudo-Class is an existing class feature of an element that can be modified to change the way the element is presented on the page.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is the degree to which an element is prioritized in CSS/the degree to which an element has been refined.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

You might find that many of your elements are operating at the highest specificity... thus conflicted all over the place.
