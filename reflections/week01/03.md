## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

I'd say the most beneficial tip I learned was the concept of hierarchy, and how every element on the page must exist in a theoretical order of importance.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

dribbble, bootstrapmade, themefisher

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

I think good design can both encourage people to use your page in the way it's been designed to, and to gain a particular professional or aesthetic impression.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

From the smile challenge I learned that you should probably know what size your workstation screen is when you do web development. From the site clone, I am learning that cloning a website when you don't have access to its code is a big pain. And also that bootstrap is much nicer than no bootstrap.
