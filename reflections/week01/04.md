## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?  

Wire framing is meant to act as a template, simple or complex, for your webpage before you develop it.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There is low, medium, and high fidelity wireframes, and they are all useful depending on where you are in the process of development. Low is better for early pitches and brainstorming, medium for design templating, and high for specificity and refinement.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think it depends. At times, you may need to show people who do not possess design skills how your project will look. Additionally, a wireframe might help you visualize yourself your design process.
