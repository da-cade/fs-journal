## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

  Scope defines an area of code in which variables and objects exist. Global scope is the whole document, while function scope means that outside of that function a scoped variable does not exist.

2. What is Hoisting ?

  Hoisting is raising a variable to the top of the scope <em> of the block in which it is defined<em>. It becomes a 'global' variable within that block.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

  var has limited uses. If you wanted a variable to exist at a global level but to also be re-declarable or updatable at a lower scope, you might use it. Otherwise, let is best practice for variables and objects you expect to change, and const for those you don't.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I learned some cool stuff about Objects. I learned about computed properties and about shorthand functions for assigning properties, as well as how to max a simple list of objects that can be sourced by each object's key.
