## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

<strong>Function Declaration:<strong> function name(parameters) {} -- This method hoists a function to the top of the scope, allowing it to be called before it is defined. This is standard syntax for global-level functions.
<strong>Function Expression:<strong> let name = function(parameters) {} -- This defines a named or anonymous function as a variable, which is useful if your function has a return value that is not 'undefined.'
<strong>Arrow Function:<strong> let name = (parameters) => {} -- shorter way for writing the above style of function, except they do not generate <em>this<em> values.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

A parameter is something that a function requires to operate. It is a placeholder for a variable that will be used within the function. An argument is what you call that variable.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as a parameter, or which returns a function.
One example is the prototype.find method.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Ooooohhwweeeee I'd say I learned a good amount about the find and filter methods. Frankly, before this assignment I had no idea what an arrow function was and now I feel better about them.
