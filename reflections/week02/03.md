## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

The main ways are console.log() and console.error()/throw new Error. Errors are useful for specific back-end development cases in which you want to articulate exactly where code is not working and why. Console.log() is best for almost every other scenario.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

That is the Elements tab. This tab allows you to change the content and appearance of your html and css and see the updates in real time. You can also copy these changes for application in your local code.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

The debugger is the supreme way of checking code. It allows you to step through your code as you like, pause it at any point, and see the values of temporary objects, arguments, and variables.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

This task challenged me, but I feel much more confident about using 'dictionaries' (if that's even what they really are) in JavaScript, and in iterating over their contents using the for-in loop. I was actually very happy with what I was able to accomplish with this project and will probably emulate it to a certain degree for the checkpoint if possible.
