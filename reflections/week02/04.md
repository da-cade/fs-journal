## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

If you make a plan before you begin, you spend more time considering which approaches/metholodogies are best. This is important not only for saving time but for reducing coupling. It's better to have code that is less complex but which also requires fewer changes to accomodate new features.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Rubber duck method ain't bad. It's good to use methods like console.log() and the debugger, but even more important may be the process you use to articulate your program to yourself. What should the program be doing, and why does your code equate to that?

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Well it's a big article, and there's a lot I didn't understand. But my biggest takeaway was probably that I could "refactor" my time by spending less time coding and more time planning ahead.
