## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

Using exports means you won't need to rewrite code everywhere you want to use it.

2. How does export differ from export default?

Sometimes a file can have multiple possible exports, but using "export default" ensures that you only have one.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

At least one benefit is increased security, but perhaps more useful is better organization and increased decoupling. Module code is highly reusable.
