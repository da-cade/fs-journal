## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is meant to limit the amount of data available outside of an object's method.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

One issue is that many people do not know the nomenclature that _function means it should be private. Additionally, the way people use these functions is often not proper encapsulation, resulting in an attack surface for hackers.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

You can create private variables by assigning anonymous functions to a variable.  variable = 0   return ({ variable: () => variable += 1})

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I felt my best about using the MVCS model during this assignment. I learned early about async and await, and I used my first ternary. But ultimately my biggest takeaway is the idea of categorizing functions for the sake of consistency rather than because the data or model forces you to.
