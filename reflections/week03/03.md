## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

Getter and setter.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

You have to make sure that you code "'return 'object[to][return]'"

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

Our ProxyState is a wrapper for the AppState, so it only allows changes if they are valid. It reduces the potential attack surface of our software, for one, but it also helps us not give ourselves bugs by throwing things into Class objects that don't belong.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Gregslist no. 1 was tough. I definitely learned a lot about forms, and about the formatting of the MVCS, though it certainly took a while.
