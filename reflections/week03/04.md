> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

The Observer Pattern allows you to work with data and user inputs in real time.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The three mechanisms are the subscribe method, the unsubscribe method, and the broadcast method.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

Essentially, the bcw-tool uses an observor pattern to create an AppState that holds the data which we broadcast and manipulate. The ProxyState, however, is an intermediary that determines that the data being manipulated is done so validly.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Well, I kinda jumped into it and even though it generally worked out and I had a pretty good idea of what I was doing, it didn't feel great. Since then I have planned a little bit more about what I want to do before diving in. Also, realized that you can instantiate a class whenever you want... I have to say, MVCS is not the simplest way to introduce an elementary concept like Classes.
