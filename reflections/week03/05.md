# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Well, a lot of people talk about how MVCS is a nightmare and how it's the most difficult week, or the biggest transition, or whatever. I personally felt fine with it. It seems to me like just a better way to store data, but it's still just an abstraction of patterns we used before.

Nevertheless, it wasn't always easy figuring out how to use it. Learning which pieces of syntax to use and when was probably the biggest challenge, but after a week I'd say I feel comfortable with just about everything except Setters, which I probably should have utilized to a greater degree during the Checkpoint. I probably would have felt more comfortable if I had done the readings for the week in advance.

I feel glad that I am learning how to be more efficient and effective with my time, though. I'd call just about the whole week a success.
