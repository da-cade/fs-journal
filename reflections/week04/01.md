> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

You may be in callback hell if you have a pyramid of brackets. Your code is too deep, with too many nested functions. Also, you could be trying to handle events before they've finished completing.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous means something is outside of the call stack. It is paired with an await that is inside the function. Anything after await won't happen until <em>after</em> the await has finished completely.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Hoist your functions to the top, don't nest (anonymous) functions, and handle all possible errors.
