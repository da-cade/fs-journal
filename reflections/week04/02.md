> **ðŸ“– [JavaScript Promises](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/02-Promises)**

## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending, fulfilled, and rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Promises stagger asynchronous functions by using .then() to call functions only after the promise has been satisfied.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

.then() is used if a Promise is successful, and .catch() if it fails.
