You have to declare async at the beginning of the function.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Well, honestly, I learned a lot about API's and data from my discussion with Harrison: best practices, and the ethics of cloning API's. From the assignment however I'm starting to piece together the syntax of what we're doing. It's just like everything we've done before but extra steps, yet with those extra steps come tricks and shortcuts. Having an active object is a neat workaround over finding objects in our ProxyState arrays.
