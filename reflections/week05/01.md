## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

The purpose of a query string is to format information for websites.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

Queries begin with a '?' and are followed by the argument and an '='. Parameters are separated by '&'.

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

Query parameters seem extremely useful, but I don't know how. My first guess is that it allows you to know how your own queries will be formatted on other websites, and how to retrieve information from other API's in your server.
