## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One to one (1:1), one to many (1:N), and many to many (N:M)

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Well, I thought embedding was traditional, but linking is better when you are anticipating more than just a few working items in your relationship. Linking allows better control over how the content is displayed because the parent object doesn't need to hold all the data.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

You need to have a decent idea ahead of time about which kind of formatting to use. It's typically not a problem to use third-collection embedding from the beginning, but using one-way or two-way embedding with large data sets could lead to memory issues. Also, how the information is going to be displayed might have some impact on how you would choose to format it.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Working with Mongo at this level is essentially like using a pinhole camera. Not knowing where anything goes or comes from is odd, but I still am learning the proper syntax and the essence of this latest abstraction. Learning about virtuals was a valuable contribution to my understanding of security.
