## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

It's segmenting your time into the absolute minimum chunks necessary to complete tasks.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Well, meditation is a great way to be able to focus without being so absorbed you forget your priorities. I'll keep doing that. I think I'll try timeboxing during lab to shave off an hour it takes to complete the work on days that aren't Mondays. Also, I think I'll try that frog.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

I would have to say it would be answering this reflection, which I am doing and am actively benefitting from as I cease doing it, which I am now doing.
