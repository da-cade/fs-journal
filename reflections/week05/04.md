## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

Virtuals are cool. They're 'fake' properties that Mongo grabs from other Schemas and appends to your request body. It allows you to include information on models that you don't want actually existing on the model

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

Any time you want to call something and append information relating to its parent element. For example, if you called up a comment or a post, you might want a virtual indicating information about the user who posted it.

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

You can't brooooo~! It's not in the database. You'll have to take the long way to the data if you want to get it. Search by parentId.
