## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?

Component-Based Architecture is a way of modeling web content that recasts page data into like 'components', which are based in JS classes. It uses reactive and computed states to read data in real time and update only those values within the page.

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

It's incredibly flexible, while also providing a high degree of legibility and consistency. It allows a greater degree of exactitude when performing updates to the page, and a greater degree of freedom particularly when crafting custom componenets.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

It can be bloated, messy, illegible, and even a vain. Apparently people will use CBA to develop entire webpages, creating custom components even when it isn't necessary.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Given that I new nothing about CBA until now, I'd say that my biggest takeaway was learning the basics. Honestly it's a fascinating system and I'm happy to finally be working with other parts of even just vanilla JS, like anonymous functions.
