## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifecycle hooks are part of the Options API, and they're used to enable function calls at particular moments in the app's operation

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

Well, we always start with a mounted/onMounted to just find out if something is running, but I think even the Axios service uses create()

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

Mounting hooks allow functions to be placed onto certain places in a program or template, such that when the code meets them it runs. The app itself uses a mounting hook to connect its components to the view.
