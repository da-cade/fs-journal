## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

A nested route is routing established from a baseRoute which then has children.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

I think I might use a nested route if I was paginating, for example, although perhaps not. Any encyclopedia that would have multiple, predefined pages but for which setting up multiple router paths would be tedious might find it useful.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

You bet you can. Our router.js does this. If you need to find a specific item by clicking on a component of it, passing an id as a param is coolio.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Learned the most about routes and stuff so far, using params for calls and stuff like that. Big learning experience and some pretty interesting theory.
