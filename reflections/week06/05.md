# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I would say I was pretty behind all week. Not as much as I was in week 4, but definitely more than I was comfortable with. It was weird learning Vue and having some concepts make immediate sense while others continue to baffle me.
A victory or success was definitely thursday when I built out much of the program, using routes and so on pretty well. I enjoyed that. But I think if I could do this week over I would have watched all the videos completely, and not even just once but twice.
I'm still struggling with Vue but I am feeling much better about it. Although to tell the truth if you asked me to replicate some of the things i made in my checkpoint I'm not sure how well I'd do.
