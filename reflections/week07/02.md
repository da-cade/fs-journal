## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is applying explanatory information to your code. Typically this is done with readme's, but it can also be done with a tutorial or with notes in the source material.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

If others need to interact with your code, documentation can help explain how to use it or how it works.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Code isn't always immediately legible, even if it is as clean as possible. There are many reasons to add extra explanation to your code, and it's probably a good idea to do it particularly on experimental and open-source projects.
