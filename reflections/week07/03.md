## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

A User Experience is any instance of a user interacting with an online platform of your company. It generally prioritizes how to make that a positive experience for the user rather than only an expedient one.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

Empathizing with customers seemingly leads to a better association of feelings around your brand. It might encourage them to repeat the experience of interacting with it.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

I guess that people can't be expected simply to buy things anymore, we now have to compete for a portion of their emotional world. Or, for a less cynical answer, because it makes your brand stand out in a definitive way.
