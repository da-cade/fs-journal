# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

It was a victory to produce a high quality program but it was definitely a lesson in not ignoring what we didn't want to spend a lot of time doing.

We should have worked a bit harder to ensure that the backend functionality was properly secure. That was a rather large oversight and I suppose even though our next checkpoint deals with that it would've been better to be thinking ahead.

I am overall pretty happy with my understanding of Vue. I'm excited to keep working with it.
