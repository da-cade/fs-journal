## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

It showcases your talents, skills, and priorities. It can be better than a resume.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

An effective dev portfolio is filled with projects that are not only skilled but imbued with personal significance. This allows others to see what drives you.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I would probably include my Tower, for it's design quality, and my Planit from the pair checkpoint for its functionality.
