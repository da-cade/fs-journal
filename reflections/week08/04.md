## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

The three main types are unit, component, and end to end testing. The first is code for testing portions of a program isolated from the whole. The second is a subset of the first, but related specifically to modules or components; it's beneficial because often component based software is rarely segmented into units, despite these units being integral to the operation of a program. The third, E2E, is good for simulating a user-experience.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

The most useful is probably E2E because it is the most comprehensive, although it seems like it's still a somewhat dubious technology.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

The least useful is likely unit testing simply because it scales worse than the others.
