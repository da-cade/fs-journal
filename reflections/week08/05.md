# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week was something of a challenge. Being in a group with multiple strong programmers has offered little in the way of practical challenges and much in the way of interpersonal ones. We have been struggling to maintain a harmonious atmosphere, and frankly I foresee further disagreements in the future.

However, we are ahead of schedule in terms of the actual development of our project and I have little doubt that we will be able to integrate many of the more interesting features that we hope to create later next week. So strictly speaking, you could say that it's been a victory that despite some of our disagreement that we have managed to write a lot of good code really quickly.

To be honest, it was a bit of a surprise how little some in my group were interested in having in a say in every decision of the project, particularly design or presentation. Personally, I suspect that this is only the case for the time being.
