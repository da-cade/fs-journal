## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

Generally the SOLID principles, particularly S and I; Vue, of course, and it's reactive effects; ChartJS and VueChartJS, Firebase, MongoDB schemas, and finally, ideally, javascript.

2. What went well so far?

Well, on Monday, I guess you could say we'd finished most of our planning and I guess had most of our arguments already. So what went well was that we finished that.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I can't speak for anyone else but I guess I'd probably turn my energy down a little in the beginning.
