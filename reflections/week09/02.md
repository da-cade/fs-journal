## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

A Github Action is an automatically executed command that is triggered by many different possible types of events.

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

Lots of benefits. They allow you to run jobs simultaneously, to update information to you or within the program, and to know how people are interacting with your code on Github.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

There are webhooks, scheduled, workflow, and external. Webhooks are used for when people interact with your Github page; scheduled are set to run automatically and stated intervals; workflow respond to push, pull, fetch, and clone requests; and finally external, which is used to reference actions by programs or services that are outside the context of Github.
