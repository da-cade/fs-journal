## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

A Base64 encoded image is binary data of an image in a text/string format.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

It can increase the file size, it can mess with your SEO because it lacks a url, and it requires images to be retrieved every time.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

In the past, you had to encode images to reduce strict requests to the server. Base64 allows you to nest the code right in your html; but nowadays server capabilities mean that it's not necessary.
