## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

It's a data file that establishes encryption between the user and the page.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

For encryption and validation certificates, there are domain, organization, and extended validation; they are ranked in that order in both effectiveness and cost. For certificates defined by the domain number, the types are single, multidomain, and wildcard. These are reverse ranked in applicability.

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

SSL certificates are not only much more secure than regular http webpages, they're basically required for any page that expect to handle sensitive user data. They also can increase your SEO score and encourage users to visit a page they consider safer. Also, supposedly it can be even faster to establish SSL than to establish the connection itself.
