## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

There are value types, which directly contain their own values; there are reference types which store the address of the value rather than the value itself; the last is a pointer type, which points. jk it holds the address of a primitive type the way a reference might.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

"bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort." There's a lot more than in JS and a lot of them do weird specific things. Many of them seemed to be based in memory values.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Sort of. Their values are stored in memory but a reference type only is an address to the value. If you change the value for a reference type, you don't actually change the value in memory, you just create a new value and a new address to it.

I learned quite a bit about C# and switches. I started broad and then refactored it down.
