## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Information in a row is an entry in a database, and entries in a column are properties on taht entry.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,,
  name varchar(255) COMMENT 'User Name',
  age varchar(255) COMMENT 'User Email',
  description varchar(255) COMMENT 'User Picture'
) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
The first one will remove all the entries in the table. The second one removes the entire table.

I did a bunch of learning through SQLBolt. That plus the API version of this assignment did a lot to tell me about.
