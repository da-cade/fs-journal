## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An enum is an explicitly defined symbol for a value. They allow you to use meaningful names for important things. You might use one to attach a label to an important integer or to ascribe a tag to numeric ID's.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can explicitly declare its type, and you can declare its value. You can also cast a value to an enum.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

Noooo, not yet, but I imagine they are for more complex applications. I would probably use them when I had a program that created important values in an algorithm that I would need to keep track of, particularly if they're part of a set.
