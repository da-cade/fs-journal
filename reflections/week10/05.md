# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

OOOOOk so, learning C# has been a bLAST. I actually have learned quite a bit about it however I feel I have little to know practical knowledge outside of server syntax. Oh well. 

A SURPRISE was being given SQLBolt to practice our SQL. This is significant because that exact website was my very first foray into programming of any kind. So it's pretty special to circle back there.

A victory was definitely the stuff i did for my checkpoint. Cool router shit, cool watcheffect shit. I mean stuff. Don't tell Brittany.
