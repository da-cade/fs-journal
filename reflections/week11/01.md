## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us to give classes and their members identity and to allow us to reuse code.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Apparently in C# children don't inhereit constructors or finalizers, whatever that second thing is. It's probably a good thing they don't inherit constructors however because it would cause some messy stuff with class properties.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

If something is private, it can't be accessed by its children unless its in the class itself. Otherwise, things are accessible based on their relation to their base class, where internals can see across assemblies and protecteds are meant to be passed to children.
