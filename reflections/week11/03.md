## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

SQL injection is the practice of inserting a string of malicious SQL into a database in order to take control of that database or ruin it.

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

The first is user input, the second is through cookies and locally stored site data, and the third is through forged request headers.

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

Web Application Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems, and ORM's like Dapper can all be helpful, but utlimately its best consult a list or to use a service like SQLmap to see how vulnerable your program really is. It's also a good idea to reduce the privileges of your application to the very minimum needed to run.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

It was good to review a bit about C#, and learning how to implement interfaces and viewmodels was a helpful addition, however I think I typically prefer joins.
