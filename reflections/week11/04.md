## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I feel RASPY and RAW. I've been coarsened by long weeks of toil but I am burnished to wood silver like a log of white oak battered by salt spray and sun.

I feel pretty satisfied with this course, and I'm about as nervous for the final as I am dissatisfied with my learning. Maybe I'm just being sanguine but I don't think it's going to be more difficult than the Gauntlet, and I've been practicing a lot where Vue is concerned in particular, and I am not really having trouble with SQL since I was lucky enough to have done it before. I'll probably spend all of Friday planning, and then get to work planning 8 hours a day plus breaks from there until the next Friday. I could imagine being able to find things to fiddle with on it even if I finish early.

Ultimately my favorite thing about the course has beeeeeen probably a tie between the instruction and the creativity possible within the projects. I love the real feeling of applicability and competance I'm gaining, and the frequent discussion of my possible job prospects. I'm very curious about what the working world is like, but I'm probably going to miss these days of study once I'm locked into professional frameworks. I really wonder how ready I'll be but at least I might look more appealing to employers than I did before.
