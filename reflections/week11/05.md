# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Thiiiiiiiiis week I really spent most of my time working on AllSpice and career services homework. I spent a lot of time on making a particular live-edit feature work for AllSpice, so you can imagine my surprise finding out about something called 'content editable.' It remains to be seen whether this is a 1 for 1 replacement for what I made, but I'm nevertheless proud that I was able to create EXACTLY what I envisioned.
